This is a compliation of my initial works using the opencv and pytesseract library in python. 
This compilation includes projects that make use of concepts around Image Processing, with the highlight being:
Image THresholding
Smoothing
Morphological Transformations
Canny Edge Detections
Contours
Template Matching
Histogram
Hough Lines and Circles

The files also includes models with trained datasets of gujarati and sanskrit languages to extract texts from images using tesseract
